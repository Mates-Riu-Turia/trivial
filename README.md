# TRIVIAL from IES Riu TÃºria

## About

This project use is to make a simple interface to a Trivial hosted in the HighSchool.
The students can create some questions at the end of the unit. Then their teachers will correct them for adding them to the final game.
The game, is really similar to the orginal board game of the Trivial, it has got a board, a timer, a ranking and a place for the questions. It is multiuser so you can play anywhere with anyone.

## Technologies used

It is written in HTML5, JS, CSS3 and Bootstrap5 for the frontend. And Rust for the backend.
The IDE that I used is VS Code.
As a wish, I want to translate the frontend to a React.js based application, this would help for code readbility.
